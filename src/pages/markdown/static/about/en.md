### _David Eads, Asraa Mustufa, Fernando Diaz, and Olivia Obineme_

GovBook provides basic contact information for every unit of government that reports to the Illinois Comptroller.

## How often is the site updated?

We try to update the site at least once a day, but the data changes sporadically.

## What's in the data?

The source data contains self-reported, high-level contact information for local units of government in Illinois from the most recent Annual Financial Report or Registration Report submitted to the state Comptroller.

Each unit is described by:

* Unit name: The name of the unit
* Description: The type/category of unit, e.g. "City" or "Road & Bridge"
* County: The listed county
* Code: The unit's unique identifier

The data includes the same types of contacts for each unit of government:

* General contact information, often the executive and/or finance officer
* Chief executive officer (CEO), often a mayor or agency head
* Chief financial officer (CFO), the person in charge of accounting
* Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) Officer, the person in charge of FOIA requests
* Purchasing agent, the person in charge of purchasing decisions
* Tax Increment Financing (TIF) administrator, the person in charge of TIF districts

Many units only have a few of these roles.

Each type of contact includes:

* First name
* Last name
* Title
* Street address
* City
* State
* ZIP
* Phone (plus optional extension)
* Fax
* Email

## Are these all the contacts for each government unit?

This data doesn’t include the full contact information for all employees or agents of a unit of government. This is an area where we need your help. Want the contact information for the Schaumburg village board? [Let us know](mailto:deads@chicagoreporter.com). 

## Can I search by the name of a government officer?

Currently, you can search for the name of the government unit, the type of unit, the county the unit is in, and the name of the reported chief executive officer. We hope to add the ability to search for any officer’s name in the near future.

## Where can I learn more about the data?

This data is [collected and published](https://illinoiscomptroller.gov/financial-data/local-government-division/) by the lllinois Comptroller's office. [The Comptroller provides a PDF data dictionary](ftp://ftp.illinoiscomptroller.com/LocGov/AboutUnitData.pdf) for the data.

## What if the data needs to be updated? Do you have ideas about how to make this more useful?

Please [let us know](mailto:deads@chicagoreporter.com) and we'll follow up.

If you are comfortable with Github, [you can also create an issue](https://github.com/thechicagoreporter/govbook/issues/new).

## What parts of the site are translated?

Any text written by The Chicago Reporter is available in English and Spanish.

Text that comes from the Comptroller, specifically the type of a given unit of government (e.g. “Road & Bridge” or “Drainage District”), is presented as-is, even when viewing the Spanish language version of the site. Because these designations are reported in English only, we do not feel it is appropriate to attempt to translate them without further reporting.
